    <h1>Welcome to Bird Migration Tracking Visualization</h1>
    <h1>Explanation of Project</h1>
    <p>The Bird Migration Tracking Visualization project is designed to shed light on the fascinating journey of various bird species as they migrate across regions.
         Leveraging comprehensive data from the Science Base repository, our platform aims to provide bird enthusiasts, researchers, and the general public with an interactive and informative experience.
         Through detailed visualizations, users can explore patterns related to the age, location, and seasonal movements of selected bird species. By offering insights into these natural phenomena, we hope to foster a deeper appreciation for avian migration and contribute to ongoing ornithological studies.</p>
